# Welcome to Eat Da Burger
Eat Da Burger is a restuarant application that allows its users to create burgers, eat them, as well as delete them.

***

## Overview
While Eat Da Burger may appear simple it is, in fact, a dynamic application built with node.js, express.js, and uses MySQL.  Using handlebars, the app will display newly created burgers on the left hand side on the screen.  After selecting to consume the burger, the database will be updated and the burgers moved to the right.  The use will then have the option to delete their eaten burger.  The application uses MVC arcitecture as well as the Object Relational Mapping technique to handle all of its CRUD operations.
